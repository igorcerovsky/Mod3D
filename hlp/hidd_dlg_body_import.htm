		<P>Import top and bottom boundary of the body. You can specify both grid files, 
			constant value for boundary, or just copy&nbsp;one boundary specifying the 
			thickness of the layer. In a case that the boundaries are going to cross both 
			values are ignored. The body can be imported only in constrains of the other 
			bodies. Already defined body has higher priority, so&nbsp;imported value will 
			be joined to the existing body.</P>

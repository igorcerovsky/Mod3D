		<P>
			<strong>Mod3D</strong> has been developed to create 3D geophysical models in an
			user friendly interactive environment. Anomalous gravity and/or magnetic fields
			are computed using formulae for polyhedral bodies. The <em>Map View</em>, <em>Profile
				View</em> and <em>3D View</em> are provided on modeled half-space. The <em>Map
				View</em> provides an overview on the model geometry projected to the
			horizontal plane, and shows bitmaps or contours of modeled field grids and
			topography. The <em>Profile View</em> provides an interface, where the
			polyhedral bodies are defined in sets of perpendicular cross sections running
			through the grid nodes. More profiles can be opened simultaneously, to get
			better overview over the geometry in both south-north and west-east directions
			respectively. Copying of the bodies or the whole cross section to the next or
			previous profile followed up by reshaping of the geometry speeds up the process
			of model creation. <em>Profile view</em> also shows curves of computed and/or
			measured and/or difference fields. Geo-referenced bitmaps could be imported
			into Mod3D, and drawn transparently to the <em>Map View</em> or <em>Profile View</em>.
			An example would be a geological map shown in <em>Map View</em>, or a seismic
			section displayed in a selected <em>Profile View</em>. Main geological units
			could be digitized in <em>Map View</em> which are shown as check marks to
			achieve better orientation in the <em>Profile View</em>. The model definition
			system controls internally the consistency of the polyhedra geometries, or
			their topology in other words. The controlling system prevents overlapping or
			crossing of the polyhedra, simplifies reshaping of the existing bodies and
			reduces time needed for model creation.

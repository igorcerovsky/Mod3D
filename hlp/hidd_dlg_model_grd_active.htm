		<P>Use this dialog box to set field components active in computation. Only checked 
			components will be active in computation. This speeds up the real-time 
			computation. If total field is checked, all corresponding components must be 
			checked!</P>
		<P><STRONG><FONT color="#ff0000">For your consideration:</FONT></STRONG> Consider, 
			that by real-time computation&nbsp;after each mouse move the field is updated 
			for all checked grids. As long as computation is done, minimum and maximum 
			values have to be updated, total field and difference field computed, new 
			contours and/or field images generated! This is time consuming process! To 
			achieve best efficiency check only those field components you need.</P>
		<P><FONT color="#ff0000"><STRONG>Attention!</STRONG></FONT> Non-active fields are 
			available, but not updated in real-time computation mode. They need to be 
			recalculated manually.</P>
